            Phishing is a type of cyberattack in which attackers try to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information, like passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. The attacker often poses as a legitimate organization or person to trick the target into revealing confidential information.

        <p>
            The purpose of phishing is typically to gain unauthorized access to accounts, commit identity theft, or steal financial information. Attackers may use this information directly for fraudulent activities or sell it on the dark web to other criminals.

            The name "phishing" indeed comes from the concept of "fishing." Just as a fisherman uses bait to catch fish, cybercriminals use fake messages or websites to "hook" victims into giving away valuable information. The term was first used in the mid-1990s by hackers who were "fishing" for passwords and financial data. The ph spelling is believed to be an homage to early hackers who used similar alternative spellings (like in phreaking for phone hacking).
